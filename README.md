# PWChange
Legacy web app to change Windows AD password from a web page.

================================================================================

This is not in active use, but is a small web page that we developed to make it
so uses could change their AD password without needed them to be using a local
computer.

This is mostly informational, but basically there are two parts to this. The
webpage and the password change executable. The web app should run with SSL
since it transfers passwords. On the server the password change executable must
be available to execute.
